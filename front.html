       Cigarette smoking is detrimental to mental health, increasing the risk of anxiety, depression, and other mental
       illnesses. Nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, can initially alleviate stress and anxiety, but
       long-term use can worsen symptoms of these conditions. 
    </p>
    <p class="description-right fade-in">
        Furthermore, smoking has been linked to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, particularly
        among individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions.
    </p>
    <p class="description-left_again fade-in">
        A 2019 study of nearly 30,000 e-cigarette users found that current users had double the odds of having a
        diagnosis of depression compared to those who had never vaped.
        </p>
    <p class="description-right_again fade-in">
        A more recent story found that tobacco-related diseases accounted for approximately 53% of deaths among people
        with schizophrenia, 48% among htose with bipolar disorder, and 50% among those with depression.
